# THE ADVERSARY'S TRIAL
## Chapter 2: "WE WERE THERE"

The courtroom reassembled with a subtle shift in the atmosphere. Where Jesus's presence had filled the space with overwhelming light and truth, now there was something more intimate—the weight of human experience, of lives lived in the shadow of both divine glory and demonic assault. The crystal floors reflected not just light now, but memories, flickering like candle flames in the translucent depths.

The Adversary sat straighter in his chair, his composure rebuilt during the recess. His lawyers—fallen angels who had taken no visible form but whispered constantly in his ears—had been busy. Dark confidence radiated from him now, as if he had found some new angle of attack.

Michael approached the bench, his armor bearing new dents that hadn't been there before. Whatever had transpired during the recess had not been peaceful.

"Your Honor," Michael announced, his voice carrying the weariness of eternal warfare, "the prosecution calls Simon Peter."

A collective intake of breath swept through the assembled host. This was different from calling the Son of God. This was calling one of them—a human, fallible, broken, redeemed.

Peter walked forward, and his steps echoed with surprising authority on the crystal floor. He was not the same frightened fisherman who had denied his Master three times. This was Peter the Rock, Peter the Apostle, Peter who had walked on water and preached to thousands. Yet the scars remained—in his eyes, in the slight tremor of his hands, in the way he glanced once toward the defendant and then quickly away.

He wore simple fisher's clothes, but they were unstained by sea spray or fish scales. His beard was streaked with gray that spoke of years spent in service, and his hands bore the calluses of both nets and chains. Most remarkably, he carried himself with the confidence of one who had been forgiven much and therefore loved much.

As he approached the witness stand, the defendant leaned forward, a predatory smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Ah, Simon," he murmured, just loud enough for the courtroom to hear. "Still trying to be the hero, I see."

Peter's step faltered for just a moment. Then he straightened, his jaw setting in familiar stubborn lines. "I am Peter," he said clearly, "and I am here to tell the truth."

The oath was administered by Gabriel, and Peter's voice rang out strong and clear: "I swear by the Living God to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."

Michael approached with reverence. "Please state your full name and occupation."

"Simon Peter, son of Jonas. I was a fisherman. I am now a fisher of men."

"And how did you come to know the defendant?"

Peter's expression darkened. "I knew him before I knew I knew him. He was there in the boat when the nets were empty. He was there in the doubts that crept in during the dark hours. He was there..." Peter's voice caught slightly, "he was there in the courtyard when I was asked if I knew my Master."

The defendant's smile widened. "Oh, this is going to be delicious."

The Judge's voice cut through the air: "The defendant will control himself or be removed from these proceedings."

Peter continued, his voice growing stronger. "But I truly met him—saw him for what he was—the night before the crucifixion. The Master looked at me with those eyes of His, and He said, 'Simon, Simon! Indeed, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.'"

A chill ran through the courtroom. Several of the twenty-four elders shifted uncomfortably in their seats.

"The defendant asked for you specifically?" Michael pressed.

"He did. Like a prosecutor requesting a particular witness." Peter's eyes fixed on the defendant. "He wanted me because he knew I was proud, impulsive, overconfident. He saw weakness where the Master saw potential."

"What did Jesus tell you about this request?"

Peter's voice grew quiet, reverent. "He said, 'But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.'"

"When you have returned," Michael repeated. "Implying you would fall first."

"I swore I wouldn't. Swore I would die before I would deny Him." Peter's voice cracked. "I meant it. In that moment, I would have died for Him."

The defendant couldn't contain himself any longer. "But you didn't die, did you, Simon? You ran. You hid. You denied you even knew Him."

Peter turned to face his accuser directly. "I did. Three times, just as He said I would. And each denial felt like a knife in my heart."

"The great Peter," the defendant sneered. "The Rock. Crumbling at the first sign of pressure."

"Yes," Peter said simply. "I crumbled. I was sifted like wheat, and I fell apart." He paused, his voice growing stronger. "But that's not the end of the story, is it?"

The defendant's smile faltered slightly.

Michael stepped forward. "Tell the court what happened after the resurrection."

Peter's face transformed, lit from within by memory. "He came to me. By the Sea of Galilee. I had gone back to fishing—gone back to what I knew, what felt safe. But He found me there." Tears began to flow down Peter's cheeks. "He made breakfast for us. Can you imagine? The Son of God, risen from the dead, making breakfast for fishermen."

"And He spoke to you?"

"Three times He asked me if I loved Him. Once for each denial. And three times I said yes, though the third time I was grieved because He kept asking." Peter's voice grew firmer. "And three times He said, 'Feed My sheep.'"

The defendant was on his feet. "Objection! This is irrelevant!"

"Overruled," the Judge replied. "Continue, witness."

Peter looked directly at the defendant. "You see, that's what you never understood. You thought breaking me was the end of the story. But He uses broken things. He restores what's shattered. He makes the weak strong." Peter's voice rose with passion. "You sifted me like wheat, but He made me into bread that could feed thousands."

"And what happened when you began to preach?" Michael prompted.

"Pentecost. Three thousand souls in one day. Then five thousand. Then more than could be counted." Peter's eyes blazed. "Every soul that came to Christ was a defeat for him. Every heart that found peace was a victory stolen from his kingdom."

The defendant's face twisted with rage. "Tell them about Ananias and Sapphira!"

Peter's expression grew grave. "Yes. Tell them about that."

Michael nodded. "Please tell the court about Ananias and Sapphira."

"A husband and wife in the early church. They sold property and brought part of the proceeds to the apostles, claiming it was the full amount." Peter's voice grew heavy. "They wanted the honor of complete sacrifice without the cost. They wanted to appear holy while holding back."

"And what happened?"

"I confronted Ananias first. I asked him, 'Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit?'" Peter's gaze fixed on the defendant. "He didn't just inspire the lie. He filled their hearts with it. Made them believe that small deceptions were acceptable, that God wouldn't notice, that they could serve two masters."

"The result?"

"They both fell dead. Immediately. Great fear came upon the whole church."

The defendant leaned back in his chair, satisfaction evident on his face. "And whose fault was that, Peter? Who killed them?"

Peter's voice was steady. "They killed themselves. You filled their hearts with deception, and they chose to embrace it. Their deaths were not punishment—they were the natural consequence of choosing lies over truth."

"But the fear—"

"The fear was holy. It reminded everyone that God is not mocked, that sin has consequences, that deception destroys." Peter's voice grew stronger. "And even that you tried to corrupt. You tried to turn holy fear into paralyzing terror, tried to make the church afraid to give, afraid to serve, afraid to trust."

Michael moved closer to the witness stand. "Were there other attacks?"

"Constant. Imprisonment, beatings, threats. You tried to silence us through persecution." Peter's voice carried the weight of memory. "You made kings and governors your instruments. You turned the very people we came to save against us."

"And yet?"

"And yet the church grew. Every time you struck us down, we got back up. Every time you scattered us, we spread further. Every time you tried to silence us, we spoke louder." Peter's voice rose with triumph. "You made martyrs of us, and their blood became the seed of the church."

The defendant's composure was cracking again. "You make it sound so noble. Tell them about your doubts. Tell them about the times you wanted to quit, the times you wondered if it was all a lie."

Peter nodded slowly. "Yes. There were dark times. Times when I wondered if I had imagined it all. Times when the persecution seemed too much, when the cost seemed too high." He paused, his voice growing quiet. "You were there in those moments, weren't you? Whispering in my ear, telling me to give up, to go back to fishing, to save myself."

"And?"

"And I remembered His words: 'When you have returned to Me, strengthen your brethren.'" Peter's voice grew firm. "I remembered that He had prayed for me specifically. That He had seen my failure and still called me to lead. That He had forgiven me and trusted me with His sheep."

Michael nodded. "Tell the court about your final warning to the churches."

Peter's expression grew solemn. "I wrote to them: 'Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.'"

"A roaring lion?"

"Yes. Not a subtle serpent, not a beautiful angel of light. A roaring lion." Peter's eyes fixed on the defendant. "Because by then, his disguises were wearing thin. The early church was learning to recognize his tactics. So he became more brazen, more vicious, more desperate."

"And your advice?"

"'Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world.'" Peter's voice carried the authority of hard-won experience. "He wants us to think we're alone, that we're the only ones suffering, that no one understands. But we're not alone. We never were."

The defendant stood again. "My turn to question this witness."

The Judge nodded. "Proceed."

The defendant approached Peter with calculated steps, his demeanor shifting to something almost seductive. "Peter, my old friend. You speak of victory, of triumph. But let's be honest about what really happened."

Peter's jaw tightened, but he remained silent.

"You denied Him three times. In front of servants and slaves. You were so afraid of a little girl that you cursed and swore you never knew Him." The defendant's voice grew silky. "What kind of rock is that?"

"A broken one," Peter replied steadily. "One that learned it needed a foundation stronger than itself."

"And the church you built on that broken rock—look at it now. Divided, corrupt, fighting amongst itself. Wars fought in His name, children abused by His priests, wealth hoarded while the poor starve." The defendant's voice grew more intense. "Is that the victory you claim?"

Peter was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice carried deep sorrow. "The church is made of people. Broken people. People who fail, who fall, who sometimes choose darkness over light." He paused, his voice growing stronger. "But that was always the plan. He didn't come to save the righteous. He came to save sinners. And sinners... sin."

"So you admit I'm winning?"

"I admit you're still fighting. But fighting and winning are different things." Peter's eyes blazed. "Every time the church falls, it gets back up. Every time it's corrupted, reformers arise. Every time it's divided, healers come to mend it. You can wound it, but you cannot kill it."

The defendant pressed on. "What about the ones who walk away? The ones who lose faith, who decide it's all a lie? What about them?"

Peter's voice grew soft. "They break my heart. Every single one." He paused, his voice growing firmer. "But some come back. Some remember. Some find their way home. And for those who don't..." Peter's voice trailed off.

"Yes?"

"He's still praying for them. Just like He prayed for me."

The defendant stepped back as if slapped. For a moment, something flickered across his face—pain, longing, rage all mixed together. Then his mask slipped back into place.

"No further questions," he said curtly.

Michael stood. "The prosecution calls James."

---

James entered the courtroom with quiet dignity, his presence less dramatic than Peter's but no less powerful. He was shorter than Peter, stockier, with the weathered hands of a craftsman and the steady gaze of one who had wrestled with truth and found it wanting nothing. His simple robes spoke of practical piety rather than grand gestures.

The defendant's reaction was immediate and visceral. He hissed like a serpent, his beautiful face contorting with undisguised hatred. "The brother," he spat. "The one who never believed."

James's response was measured, calm. "I believe now."

"After He was dead. How convenient."

"After He was risen. How magnificent."

The exchange was brief but telling. James took his place at the witness stand with the quiet confidence of one who had seen the impossible and accepted it as fact.

Michael approached with respect. "Please state your name and relationship to the primary witness."

"James, son of Joseph and Mary. I am the brother of Jesus Christ."

A murmur ran through the courtroom. The defendant's eyes narrowed. "Brother in flesh only."

"Brother in flesh and spirit," James corrected gently. "Though it took me time to understand the difference."

Michael continued. "You lived with Jesus. You saw Him daily. What was your initial reaction to His ministry?"

James's expression grew troubled. "I thought He was mad. My own brother, claiming to be the Son of God, performing miracles, gathering followers. I was embarrassed. Concerned. I wanted Him to stop."

"And the defendant's role in this?"

"I didn't know it at the time, but yes. He was there. In my doubts, my embarrassment, my anger. He made me see Jesus's ministry as a threat to our family's reputation rather than God's intervention in human history."

The defendant leaned forward. "You were being reasonable. Rational. Your brother was disrupting everything."

James turned to him with pity. "No. I was being proud. I couldn't accept that my little brother was my Lord."

"What changed your mind?" Michael asked.

"The resurrection." James's voice grew strong. "He appeared to me. Spoke to me. Showed me His hands, His side. Called me brother in a way that made everything else fade away." Tears began to flow down James's cheeks. "I fell at His feet and called Him Lord. And He lifted me up and called me friend."

"And your role in the early church?"

"I became the leader of the Jerusalem church. The practical brother, you might say. While Peter preached and Paul traveled, I stayed home and dealt with the daily problems of a growing congregation."

Michael nodded. "Tell the court about those daily problems."

James's expression grew grave. "That's where you really see his work. Not in the grand gestures, but in the small things. The petty jealousies, the arguments over money, the divisions between Jewish and Gentile believers. He was there in every whispered criticism, every hurt feeling, every moment of doubt."

"Specific examples?"

"The food distribution. Greek widows complained they were being neglected in favor of Hebrew widows. A simple administrative problem, but he turned it into a racial issue, a question of favoritism, a threat to unity." James's voice grew firmer. "We solved it by appointing deacons, but I learned something important: he doesn't need grand conspiracies. He's perfectly content to destroy the church one hurt feeling at a time."

The defendant smiled coldly. "Divide and conquer. It's worked for millennia."

"Attempted to work," James corrected. "We recognized the pattern. We learned to address problems quickly, to bring things into the light before they could fester in darkness."

"And the temptations you faced personally?"

James was quiet for a moment. "I was in a unique position. I had authority, respect, influence. I could have used that for personal gain, could have built a kingdom around myself." He paused, his voice growing reflective. "The temptation was subtle. Not to do evil, but to do good in my own strength, for my own glory."

"How did you resist?"

"I learned to rely on prayer. Not just personal prayer, but corporate prayer. When the apostles were imprisoned, when persecution came, when difficult decisions had to be made—we prayed together. And when we prayed together, his voice became much quieter."

Michael moved closer. "You wrote a letter to the scattered churches. Tell the court about your warnings."

James's voice took on the authority of a teacher. "I warned them about the source of temptation. 'Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone.'" He looked directly at the defendant. "The temptation comes from within—from our own desires, our own weaknesses. But you amplify those desires, make them seem reasonable, necessary, justified."

"And the process?"

"'Each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own lust and enticed. Then, when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.'" James's voice grew stronger. "It's a process, not an event. Desire, enticement, conception, birth, growth, death. And you're there at every stage, nurturing it, feeding it, helping it grow."

The defendant couldn't contain himself. "I don't create the desires. They're already there."

"No," James agreed. "You don't create them. You just make sure they never die."

"And your solution?"

"'Submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.'" James's voice rang with authority. "It's a simple formula. First submission, then resistance. You can't resist what you're not submitted to overcome."

The defendant's face darkened. "And if they don't submit?"

"Then they remain vulnerable. And you remain active." James's voice grew sad. "I've seen it too many times. Good people, sincere people, trying to resist temptation in their own strength. They always fail. They always give in. Because they're fighting a battle they can't win with weapons they don't possess."

Michael nodded. "The defendant wishes to cross-examine."

The defendant stood slowly, his demeanor shifting to something more dangerous. "James. The practical brother. The one who tried to keep everyone in line."

"I tried to serve."

"You tried to control. Tell the court about the Judaizers."

James's expression grew troubled. "A mistake. A serious one."

"Explain."

"Some believed that Gentile converts had to become Jews first—be circumcised, follow the law—before they could become Christians. I... allowed that teaching to continue longer than I should have."

"You endorsed it."

"I was cautious about it. I wanted to make sure we didn't lose our Jewish heritage, didn't abandon the law entirely." James's voice grew heavy. "But I was wrong. I let tradition override grace, let culture interfere with the Gospel."

"And the result?"

"Division. Confusion. Paul had to oppose Peter to his face when Peter began to separate from Gentile believers. The unity of the church was threatened."

The defendant pressed on, sensing weakness. "So you admit that your leadership nearly destroyed the early church?"

"I admit that I made mistakes. That I let fear and pride influence my judgment. That I needed correction and received it." James's voice grew stronger. "But I also learned from those mistakes. I grew. I changed. I became a better leader because of them."

"Or you just became better at hiding your prejudices."

James was quiet for a long moment. "Do you know what I learned about prejudice? About the subtle ways it operates?"

"Enlighten me."

"It's not usually hatred. It's not usually conscious. It's just... comfort with the familiar. Suspicion of the different. Preference for people who look like us, talk like us, think like us." James's voice grew firmer. "And you feed on that comfort, nurture that suspicion, strengthen that preference until it becomes division, then hatred, then violence."

"I merely work with what's already there."

"Yes. And that's what makes you so dangerous. You don't create evil out of nothing. You take good things—love of family, pride in heritage, concern for tradition—and twist them into weapons against the very people we're called to love."

The defendant's frustration was evident. "No further questions."

"The prosecution calls John."

---

The atmosphere in the courtroom shifted dramatically as John entered. If Peter had brought the weight of human experience and James the wisdom of practical leadership, John brought something else entirely—the mystical, the transcendent, the prophetic. His presence seemed to thin the veil between the visible and invisible worlds.

He was younger than the others, his hair still dark, his eyes holding depths that seemed to reflect eternity itself. He moved with a grace that spoke not of training but of transformation, as if his very atoms had been rearranged by proximity to divine love.

The defendant's reaction was immediate and violent. He leaped to his feet, his composure completely shattered. "NO! Not him! Anyone but him!"

The Ancient of Days spoke with quiet authority: "You will control yourself, or you will be bound."

The defendant sank back into his chair, but his eyes never left John. And in those eyes was something that might have been fear.

John took his place at the witness stand with serene confidence, his voice carrying the musical quality of one who had heard the song of creation.

"Please state your name and relationship to the first witness."

"John, son of Zebedee. I am the disciple whom Jesus loved."

The defendant flinched as if struck.

Michael approached carefully, sensing the power that radiated from this witness. "Tell the court about your unique experiences with the defendant."

John's voice carried the cadence of prophecy. "I saw him as he truly is. Not as he appears, not as he pretends to be, but as he exists in the spiritual realm." John's eyes fixed on the defendant. "I saw the great dragon, red, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems on his heads."

The courtroom fell silent. Several angels drew their swords instinctively.

"Describe what you saw."

"His tail drew a third of the stars of heaven and threw them to the earth. The stars were angels, and he drew them into rebellion with him." John's voice grew stronger. "I saw the war in heaven—Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon fought, and his angels fought, but they did not prevail, nor was a place found for them in heaven any longer."

"And the result?"

"He was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, 'Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren, who accused them before our God day and night, has been cast down.'"

The defendant's face was a mask of rage. "Tell them the rest, John. Tell them what you saw about the end."

John's voice grew sad. "I saw your final rebellion. After a thousand years of binding, you will be released for a little while. And you will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, whose number is as the sand of the sea."

"And?"

"And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them. And you will be cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are. And you will be tormented day and night forever and ever."

The silence that followed was deafening.

Michael stepped forward. "You also saw the defendant's work throughout history. Tell the court about the persecution of believers."

John's voice grew heavy with sorrow. "I saw the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held. And they cried with a loud voice, saying, 'How long, O Lord, holy and true, until You judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?'"

"The defendant was responsible for their deaths?"

"He was the inspiration behind every persecution, every martyrdom, every act of violence against those who followed the Lamb." John's voice grew stronger. "I saw the woman—the church—fleeing into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, because you pursued her, seeking to destroy her and her offspring."

"But she survived."

"She survived. She was given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time, from the presence of the serpent."

The defendant leaned forward. "Tell them about the beast, John. Tell them about the one I will empower."

John's voice grew grave. "I saw a beast rising up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads a blasphemous name." He paused, his voice growing stronger. "And you gave him your power, your throne, and great authority."

"My masterpiece."

"Your final failure," John corrected. "For though many will worship the beast, the Lamb will overcome him, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful."

Michael moved closer. "Tell the court about the defendant's deceptions."

"He performs great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men. And he deceives those who dwell on the earth by those signs." John's voice carried the weight of prophecy. "His power is in the lie that looks like truth, the miracle that points away from God, the sign that leads to destruction rather than salvation."

"But his time is limited?"

"His time is limited. I heard a voice from heaven saying, 'Woe to the inhabitants of the earth and the sea! For the devil has come down to you, having great wrath, because he knows that he has a short time.'"

The defendant couldn't contain himself. "Short time? I've had millennia! I've corrupted nations, destroyed lives, turned the creation against its Creator!"

John looked at him with infinite pity. "And what have you accomplished? The church is stronger than ever. Love continues to conquer hate. Truth continues to overcome lies. Hope continues to triumph over despair." His voice grew stronger. "You have raged against the dying of the light, but the light continues to shine, and the darkness has not overcome it."

"The cross-examination," the defendant demanded.

He approached John with obvious reluctance, as if every step was painful. "John. The beloved. The one who saw visions."

"I saw truth."

"You saw symbols. Metaphors. Apocalyptic imagery that could mean anything." The defendant's voice grew more confident. "Dragons with seven heads? Beasts rising from the sea? Come now, even you don't believe that literally."

"I believe what I saw."

"But how do you know you saw truth and not just... dreams? Hallucinations? The fevered imaginings of an old man on a barren island?"

John was quiet for a moment. "I know because I saw Him. I saw the Lamb, standing as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth." His voice grew stronger. "And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. But He laid His right hand on me, saying, 'Do not be afraid; I am the First and the Last. I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore.'"

"Pretty words. But what proof do you have that any of it was real?"

John smiled, and the smile was radiant. "You're still here, aren't you? Still fighting, still raging, still trying to prove that love is weak and hatred is strong. If my visions were false, if the end I saw was not real, then why are you so afraid?"

The defendant stepped back as if slapped. "I'm not afraid."

"You're terrified. Because you know that everything I saw will come to pass. You know that your time is running out. You know that the lake of fire awaits, and there is no escape, no appeal, no reprieve."

"I—"

"You know that love wins. That it has already won. That nothing you do can change the ending of the story."

The defendant's composure cracked completely. "SILENCE! I will not be lectured by a fisherman who thinks he's a prophet!"

John's voice remained calm. "I am whatever He calls me to be. And He calls me to tell the truth. The truth is that you are defeated. You were defeated at the cross, you will be defeated at the end of time, and you are being defeated right now, in this courtroom, by the testimony of those who have seen your works and chosen to follow love instead of hate."

The defendant stumbled backward, his face a mask of rage and despair. "No further questions," he snarled.

Michael stood. "The prosecution rests this phase of the case, Your Honor."

The Ancient of Days nodded. "The court will recess. When we reconvene, the final witness will be called."

As the courtroom began to fade, John remained seated, his eyes fixed on the defendant with infinite compassion. "It's not too late," he said softly. "Even now, it's not too late."

The defendant's response was a roar of rage that shook the foundations of reality itself.

The second phase of the trial was complete.

The most devastating testimony was yet to come.
